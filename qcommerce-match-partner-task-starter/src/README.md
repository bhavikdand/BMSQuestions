# Implement ratings functionality for movies

## Problem Statement
We are building a Quick Commerce Delivery platform like Swiggy or Zomato. As a part of this system we need to build a functionality which will match a delivery partner with a task.

## Requirements
This functionality will get a list of delivery partners and a list of tasks. It will then match the delivery partners with the tasks and return a list of matched delivery partners.
We will have access to delivery partners latest location and the pickup location of the task. The partner who is closest to the task should be matched with the task.
Note: this is only 1 of the ways to match a partner and a task, in future we might want to match based on other criteria as well. So make sure to keep the code extensible.
You will need to use haversine distance formula to calculate the distance between partner's location and task's pickup location.
Make sure you have basic checks in place like if the partner is already matched with a task then do not match it again.
In case if # of partners and # of tasks are not equal, then try to match as many partners as possible.
Once you have a list of partner task mappings, no need to persist in the database, just return the list of mappings.

## Instructions
1. Carefully look at classes in `dtos` package. These classes represent the request and response of the functionality which we want to implement.
2. Carefully examine the models package to understand the database schema.
3. Implement the `matchPartnersAndTasks` method inside the `MatchPartnerTaskController`.
4. Implement the `MatchPartnerTaskService` interface and fix the repository interfaces.
5. You might need to add annotations like `@Service`, `@Autowired`, `@Entity` etc. to make the solution work. You might also need to handle cardinality between the models.
6. We will be using H2 database which is an in-memory SQL database. You do not need to implement any database related code. You just need to use the repository interfaces to interact with the database.
7. Refer the `DistanceUtils` class for the haversine distance formula.
